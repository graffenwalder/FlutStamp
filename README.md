# FlutStamp

Uses different Bitstamp API calls

## Getting Started

This app is a follow up on the bitcoin ticker challenge in [The Complete Flutter Development Boot Camp Using Dart](https://www.appbrewery.co/).
The main purpose is to test the skills learned.

The app let's you select one of the Bitstamp markets, after which you can choose to view:
- Ticker Info for the last 24 hours:
  - Order Book Info
  - Trade History
